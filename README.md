- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Haoyang(Max) Chen. I am currently a fourth-year(Honours) student in Australian National University. My degree is bachelor of advanced computing. 
My specializations are artificial intelligence and intellgent system.
- My honours project is about combining machine learning with music. Since I am interested in both areas, I am really passionate about my project.
- I love competitive programming and machine learning and I hope that I could use these knowledge to build some useful applications in real world.
- If you have any creative ideas about combining machine learning with music, I am keen to have a discussion. My current email is u6548263@anu.edu.au.
